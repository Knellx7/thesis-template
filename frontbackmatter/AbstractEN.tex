	\chapter*{Abstract}
Many companies have gained experience with Docker in recent years. With the increasing complexity of applications, Kubernetes is often used as a solution for container orchestration\footnote{\label{foot:orchestrationEN}Organizing containers} to further expand the container infrastructure. \medskip 

With the use of such a solution and the associated change into an often fast moving dynamic environment, the persistent storage of data poses a challenge.  \medskip
    
As with the use of containers, data is only available as long as the application exists. To prevent this, Docker and Kubernetes offer a variety of ways to persistently store data.  \medskip
    
The Bachelor's thesis gives an overview of different persistence solutions in Kubernetes and the technology behind them. Based on this analysis, the solutions are evaluated according to a catalogue of requirements and a recommendation for action is derived for an existing Kubernetes cluster. The findings are then applied to this cluster and the persistence solution is set up.
